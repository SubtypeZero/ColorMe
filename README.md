FAQ
---
###Q: How does this plugin color my chat?

A: Every time you type a message in chat, ColorMe will put the color code you selected directly in front of the message.

###Q: Will I still be able to use other colors if I use this plugin?

A: Yes, since ColorMe only puts the color code you selected in front of your message, you can still use chat formatting codes in your messages.
